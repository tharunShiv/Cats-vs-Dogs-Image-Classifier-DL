## Cats-vs-Dogs-Image-Classifier-DL

### About
In this project, we will train the model such that, the model is able to accurately determine whether the animal in the image is a Dog or a Cat.

### Dataset
We have a folder containing images for training and testing, under each of which we also have two folders each containing images of Cats and Dogs of various breeds, angles, views etc.,

### Algorithm
We will be applying Convolutional Neural Networks using Keras - Tensorflow Backend. We will also perform data augmentation to demonstrate how lesser number of images could also lead to better models.
